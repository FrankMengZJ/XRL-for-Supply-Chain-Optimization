# XRL for Supply Chain Optimization
In this repo, we explored the use of interpretable machine learning models to solve complex, multi-echelon supply chain problems, bridging the gap between high-performance "black-box" models and the need for transparent, auditable decision-making.

This project was developed and tested using Python 3.8. We strongly recommend using a virtual environment to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts.
